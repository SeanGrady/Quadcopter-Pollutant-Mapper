# Quadcopter-Pollutant-Mapper

The goal of this project is to provide an airborne sensing and mapping platform for a prototype air quality sensor.

This repository will contain the code to read data from the sensor and fly the quadcopter accordingly, in order to acomplish tasks like finding sources of pollutants or mapping the air quality across a region.
